## INTRODUCTION

This repository is made to keep track of the projects I created to practice my Ruby skills and learn many new things as a part of the Odin Project.

# <li> Ceasar cipher 

Ceasar cipher is a basic encryption technique which ciphers a text replacing each letter with a letter shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. That basic code defines a method that takes a string and a shift factor and returns an 'encrypted' string. </li>

# <li>Substring counter

 This method takes a word (or a phrase containing multiple words) as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original word/phrase and how many times it was found.
</li>
