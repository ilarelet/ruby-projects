This repository is made to keep track of the projects I created to practice Ruby my skills
and learn many new things as a part of the Odin Project.

1. Ceasar cipher is a basic encryption technique which ciphers a text replacing each letter 
    with a letter shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. 
    That basic code defines a method that takes a string and a shift factor and returns an 
    'encrypted' string.
